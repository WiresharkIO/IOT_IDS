## Anomaly Detection In IOT Networks

This project is supervised by prof. Sikora, Axel as a part of academics, University of Freiburg.

This repository deals with the analysis and implementation of Intrusion Detection in Industrial Internet Of Things(IIOT) network based on ML models and TinyML Inferences.

> Updates:
1. Added XGBoost classifier and converted it to ONNX model to make it deployable at microcontrollers such as STM32.
This provided an accuracy of 99% for a considerably medium-sized subset of the dataset.
2. Quantized the model using ONNX dynamic quantize.
3. Updated inferencing code to check model output using ONNX runtime.

> To do:
further optimizations of the XGBoost model to reduce memory footprints.
